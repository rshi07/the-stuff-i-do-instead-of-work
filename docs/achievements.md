## TETR.IO

This is one of the most popular sites for a competitive free "block stacking game". The ranked mode is called Tetra League and is relatively competitive, with 50 000 ranked players. As of july 2025, I hover around #500 globally. I have 740 hours on tetrio alone, and probably have enough on other sites to add up to 1000. I spent an insane amoount of time on this game, good enough to stomp the majority of people, but not good enough to win tournaments.

## Minesweeper

This is the other game i play in class since my school laptop is garbage. I have an 82 second clear on expert on minesweeper.online (aka world of minesweeper) and a 124% efficiency clear. Both are honestly improvable if I played more often. In their (somewhat flawed) ranking system, I'm apparently rated #3824 as of july 24 2025,

## Celeste

Celeste is great, everyone should play it. In grade 10-11, I played a lot of modded Celeste, with my hardest clear being Nelumbo, a high grandmaster level from the Strawberry Jam mod. I got about halfway through the solar express and got burnt out, although i should probably play celeste again soon since it's one of my favourite games.

## Sound Voltex

Made controller, made home setup, hit Volforce 15, currently 15,25 or something. Don't have any footage yet, will put it in later.
