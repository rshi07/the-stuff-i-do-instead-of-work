# About Me

{: .no_toc }

## Who am I?

{: .no_toc }

I'm a former St Augustine STEM+ student, class of 2025, going to York University to study computer security. Teachers probably don't know me, but if they do it's either because I play games in class, or I don't hand in homework (probably due to playing games). Except maybe the tech teachers (Mr Cadawas, Mr Cheng, Mr Fabroa). I did relatively well on tech classes since I'm somewhat interested in the topic, did alright in math courses until calculus due to extracurricular math (asian parents), and did crap on pretty much everything else. I tend to do zone out completely on subjects that don't interest me, which really didn't bode well for my marks.

## What else do I do apart from playing games?

{: .no_toc }

- walk to t&t or king's square to buy crappy snacks/drinks that were on sale (again, asian)
- watch videos on youtube. pretty proud of not having installed tiktok, and not constantly swiping through short videos for an hour. instead i watch multi-hour videos in one sitting. i personally really enjoy video essays of literally any topic.
- i used to read a lot of manga/manhwa, probably should've made a list somewhere. at one point in time i probably was caught up to about half the series on reaper and asurascans. personal favourite manga is grand blue dreaming by kenji inoue and kimitake yoshioka. read all sorts of genres from romance and slice of life, to action and comedy, to seinen. and of course terrible isekai/fantasy.
- weekly badminton training, am not good at it at all though
- very beginner CTFs at the end of grade 12
- built a sound voltex controller after harassing Mr Fabroa for 4 months to cut the wood/acrylic panels, thank you Mr Cheng and Mr Cadawas for letting me use your solder/soldering iron, was fun
- messed around with ricing linux in grade 11, still use EndeavourOS on school laptop. No fancy setups at the moment, just KDE Plasma, but was looking at this scrolling wm called niri that I might give a shot.
- that's about it honestly, it was kind of a sad high school experience, nerd holes up in his room playing games

got my security+ cert in the summer after grade 12 though so at least i did something for my future
