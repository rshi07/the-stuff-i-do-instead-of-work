# I regret that grad quote so much

{: .fs-9 }

## I'm Ryan Shi and I made this website out of sheer boredom

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This is my website, an introspective on how I mastered the art of procrastination. Also serves as a cautionary tale to whoever else sucks at time management, and I guess the consequences of that.

I think the sidebar titles should be relatively intuitive enough, but this is the homepage and I guess it might help some people.

- About Me: i play games, also other hobbies
- Achievements: the stuff i'm actually proud of
- Impact: how wasting time impacted school/family/whatnot
- timeline: an incredibly crap fragmented reconstruction of what games i was playing each year by semester
- games folder: list of games i played, with my thoughts

maybe i should've put more effort in this if i was going to make this my grad quote lol
